                <p>Bad bunny is a Puerto Rican musician. He made the first all-spanish record to get to the number one spot on the Billboard 200. He isnt afraid to show his style and dresses very off-beat. Bad Bunny went so far as to say in an interview "I'm pleased that we are in a time where I don't need to change anything about myself — not my musical style, not my language, not my culture — to go far. That doesn't mean I'll never sing in English. I already sang in Japanese, so maybe one day I'll sing in English. It feels great to do things my way."</p>
